# Hell Triangle - Challenge
# Given a triangle of numbers, find the maximum total from top to bottom
# Example:
# 6
# 3 5
# 9 7 1
# 4 6 8 4 In this triangle the maximum total is 6 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 26
# An element can only be summed with one of the two nearest elements in the next row
# So the element 3 in row 2 can be summed with 9 and 7, but not with 1
# Choose the programming language you wantâ€¦ let us know about why is that your choice
# Besides the solution itself, write an automated test for your code (using a known framework
# or just another function/method)
# Your code will receive an (multidimensional) array as input.
# The triangle from above would be:
# example = [[6],[-3,-5],[9,-7,1],[4,6,8,4]]

example = [[-1], [1, 3]]
